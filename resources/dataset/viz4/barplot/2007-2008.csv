Daily consumption of fruit did not meet recommendation,Low daily fruit consumption,fruit,"7,648.10",48.56,0.49,Moderate positive correlation,"15,751.00","6,882.90",You want to avoid fruit :(,"This suggests that there is a moderate tendency for higher fruit consumption to be associated with higher obesity rates. However, correlation does not imply causation. It doesn't mean eating fruit causes obesity, but rather that in the dataset, people who consume more fruit tend to have higher obesity rates for some reason. Other factors could be influencing both fruit consumption and obesity."
Daily consumption of vegetables did not meet recommendation,Low daily vegetable consumption,vegatable,"14,689.10",93.26,-0.41,Moderate negative correlation,"15,751.00","6,882.90",You want to eat more veggie!,"This suggests a moderate tendency for higher vegetable consumption to be associated with lower obesity rates. This could imply that higher vegetable intake is associated with lower obesity, possibly due to healthier eating habits overall. Again, this is a correlation, not a causation."
Alcohol cunsumption exceeded lifetime risk guidelines(n),Excessive alcohol cunsumption,alcohol,"3,294.00",20.91,-0.94,Strong negative correlation,"15,751.00","6,882.90","More al, less fat!","This suggests a strong tendency for higher alcohol consumption to be associated with lower obesity rates. This is quite counterintuitive, as excessive alcohol consumption is often linked with higher caloric intake and weight gain. This strong negative correlation could be influenced by other lifestyle factors or could indicate an anomaly in the data."
Daily smoker,Daily smoker,smoke,"2,980.30",18.92,-0.95,Strong negative correlation,"15,751.00","6,882.90","More smoking, less fat!","This suggests a strong tendency for smoking to be associated with lower obesity rates. This is a well-documented phenomenon where smokers tend to have lower body weight, possibly due to nicotine's appetite-suppressing effects. However, smoking has many other severe health risks."
Zero minutes of physical activity (ah),No physical activity,physical,"3,151.40",20.01,-0.77,Strong negative correlation,"15,751.00","6,882.90",Exercise more!,"This suggests a strong tendency for higher physical activity levels to be associated with lower obesity rates. This aligns with general expectations, as physical activity is known to help maintain a healthy weight."
